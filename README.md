CppLUT is a tool for importing, exporting, and manipulating [3D look up tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_lookup_table) (3D LUTs) and 1D look up tables (1D LUTs) for colors. LUTs are often used in film and video finishing, graphics, video games, and rendering. Based on [CocaLUT](https://github.com/datascienceteam01/cocoalut).

The goal of this project is to have a fast, C++ library with cross platform support.
